# Splitmode

## Requirements

Create interactive split mode for tic-tac-toe game based on your existing layout, allowing two users share same screen and controls play the game and collect score.

## Here some checkpoints (not strict though)

* Start with tic-tac-toe layout you've done
* New game menu should clear game field and score
* Current player is highlighted in scoreboard
* Each player may click on empty cell and put cross or circle there
* Players are changing turn-by-turn
* Player can't overwrite filled cell
* When game is over, collect score: win - 2 points, draw - 1 point, lose - 0
* When game is over, ask user to start new game or to continue with collected score


*I'll provide some hints in this repository later to give you the right direction, but this task is about experimenting*

## Advanced challenges you may want to apply:

* Use your colleague's layout implementation after you finish yours. How much it would take?
* Create AI for single player
* Create AI with configurable difficulty level :)
* Use different event-handling (or even architecture) approaches. Which would be better?
* Consider using javascript MVC library or framework
